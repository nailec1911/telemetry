# Telemetry Viewer

This project provides a **graphical viewer** for telemetry data, allowing users to load, and visualize time-series telemetry logs. It is implemented using **Python and PyQtGraph** for fast, interactive plotting.

## Features

- Load a telemetry file and display its time-series data
- Select which variable (series) to visualize
- Zoom and pan on the graph using the mouse

## Installation
### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

### 2. Install Required Dependencies

Run the following command to install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- PyQt6 → For GUI components
- PyQtGraph → For fast plotting
- pandas → For data handling
- numpy → For efficient numerical operations

## Usage

To launch the telemetry viewer, use:

```bash
./telemetry_viewer <file name>
```

If no file is provided, you can open a file manually using the GUI.
you can also use ``./telemetry_viewer --help`` to see the ``USAGE``:
```
$> ./telemetry_viewer --help
usage: telemetry_viewer [-h] [FILE]

A visualizer for telemetry files.

positional arguments:
  FILE        File to analyze (optional).

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

## File Format

The viewer expects a telemetry file generated by the telemetry recording system. The format is structured as series of timestamped values, supporting:
- Double (float) values
- String values (not plotted, but parsed)

## Library Choices

### 1️. GUI Framework: PyQt6 + PyQtGraph

Why PyQt6?
- Easy implementation
- Provides a flexible GUI
- Supports dialogs, menus, and interactivity

Why PyQtGraph?
- Optimized for real-time plotting
- Faster than Matplotlib for large datasets

Moreover, Pyqt and PyqtGraph offer many features and customization option, which makes them perfect for future improvements.

### 2. Data Handling: Pandas + NumPy
Why Pandas?
- Handles time-series data efficiently
- Provides built-in sorting & filtering
  
Why NumPy?
- Fast numerical processing
- Easily converts to formats usable by PyQtGraph

### 3. Command-Line Argument Handling: argparse

Why argparse?
- Easy to implement
- Has a lot of possibilities if we need to add features
- Standardized approach for handling command-line inputs in Python.

## Implementation choices

### Why Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was chosen to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability in the telemetry viewer.
The biggest advantage of OOP are :

1. Code Reusability & Maintainability
    - The ``Serie`` class can be reused or extended for additional features (supporting new data types like vectors).
    - The GUI (``TelemetryGUI`` class) is separate from the data-handling logic, following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
    - This allows for easier improvements without modifying the entire codebase (it is also easier to test).

2. Scalability
    - More features (real-time data streaming, data combination ..) can be easily added without breaking existing functionality.
    - If a new type of telemetry data is introduced, a class can be changed without affecting other parts of the system.

### Encapsulation of Telemetry Data : ``class Serie()``

The Serie class encapsulates each telemetry series, keeping data structured and self-contained.

Each instance of Serie stores:
- ``name: str`` → The name of the series (ex: "battery_level")
- ``unit: str`` → The measurement unit (ex: "V", "km"...)
- ``value_type: type`` -> The type of the serie (str, int ...)
- ``values: pd.Series`` → A pandas Series mapping timestamps to values


## Future Improvements

- Add support for streaming real-time telemetry
- Improve UI to show multiple graph at once
- Add more serie types (point, vector, map ...)
